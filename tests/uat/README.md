# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Guide

## Overview

This directory contains User Acceptance Tests (UAT) for the FabManage-Clean2 project. UAT is performed by end-users to validate that the system meets business requirements and is ready for production use.

## Test Structure

### Test Categories

1. **Business Process Tests** - Validate complete business workflows
2. **User Experience Tests** - Verify usability and user satisfaction
3. **Performance Tests** - Ensure acceptable performance from user perspective
4. **Accessibility Tests** - Validate accessibility requirements
5. **Security Tests** - Verify security from user perspective

### Test Participants

- **Product Owner**: Validates business requirements
- **End Users**: Production management staff
- **Project Managers**: Workflow validation
- **Quality Assurance**: Test coordination and reporting

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. Staging environment setup with production-like data
2. Test user accounts with appropriate permissions
3. Test scenarios prepared and reviewed
4. Acceptance criteria defined for each feature

### Test Process

1. **Test Planning**: Define test scenarios and acceptance criteria
2. **Test Preparation**: Setup test environment and data
3. **Test Execution**: End-users perform tests with real scenarios
4. **Result Recording**: Document findings and issues
5. **Sign-off**: Obtain formal approval from stakeholders

## Test Scenarios

## Test Documentation

### Test Cases

Each test case includes:
- **Test ID**: Unique identifier
- **Test Description**: Clear description of what to test
- **Pre-conditions**: Setup requirements
- **Test Steps**: Detailed steps to execute
- **Expected Results**: What should happen
- **Actual Results**: What actually happened
- **Status**: Pass/Fail/Blocked
- **Comments**: Additional notes

### Test Results

Test results are documented in:
- Individual test case files
- Summary report
- Issue tracking system
- Sign-off documentation

## Issue Management

### Issue Categories

1. **Critical**: Blocks primary business functions
2. **High**: Significantly impacts user experience
3. **Medium**: Minor inconvenience to users
4. **Low**: Enhancement or nice-to-have

### Issue Resolution

- Medium and Low issues can be addressed in future releases
- All issues are tracked in the project management system

## Sign-off Process

### Acceptance Criteria

- All critical test scenarios pass
- No critical or high-priority issues remain
- Performance meets defined benchmarks
- Security requirements are satisfied
- Accessibility standards are met

### Sign-off Requirements

- Product Owner approval
- End-user acceptance
- Technical team sign-off
- Quality assurance approval

## Tools and Templates

- Test case templates in `templates/` directory
- Test data sets in `data/` directory
- Result tracking spreadsheets
- Issue reporting templates

## Best Practices

1. **Real User Scenarios**: Use actual business processes
2. **Production-like Environment**: Test in realistic conditions
3. **Diverse Users**: Include users with different skill levels
4. **Complete Workflows**: Test end-to-end processes
5. **Documentation**: Record everything thoroughly
6. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback quickly

## Timeline

Typical UAT timeline:
- **Week 1**: Test planning and preparation
