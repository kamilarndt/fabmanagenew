# Cursor AI Rules for FabManage Project

## Project Context
- React TypeScript project with Ant Design components
- Dark mode tech aesthetic with professional design system
- SVG generation optimized for Figma plugin compatibility
- Atomic Design methodology implementation

## SVG Generation Rules
- When converting TSX to SVG, always create structured groups for Figma plugin compatibility
- Use semantic naming: ELEMENTS, GROUPS, VARIANTS, COMPONENT
- Include figma-specific metadata and data attributes
- Maintain visual hierarchy with proper nesting
- Add descriptive titles and descriptions for each component group

## Component Structure
- ELEMENTS: Individual Ant Design components (Card, Progress, Tag, Avatar, Space, Typography, Button)
- GROUPS: Functional combinations of elements (ProjectHeader, ProjectMeta, ProjectInfo)
- COMPONENT: Complete UI components (ProjectCard)
- VARIANTS: Different versions (Compact, Detailed)

## Figma Integration
- Add `data-figma-component` attributes for component identification
- Include `<title>` and `<desc>` elements for documentation
- Use `class` attributes for categorization (element, group, variant, main-component)
- Implement proper `id` naming in PascalCase
- Add Figma plugin metadata in `<defs>` section

## Design System
- Follow dark mode tech aesthetic
- Use design system colors from design-system.css
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Preserve Ant Design component styling
- Include proper gradients and visual effects

## Code Quality
- Always validate SVG structure before completion
- Ensure proper viewBox and responsive scaling
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Test compatibility with Figma plugins
- Maintain clean, readable code structure

## File Organization
- Place SVG files in figma-exports/components/[component-name]/
- Include CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md for each component
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document all generated files

## Best Practices
- Use transform attributes for positioning instead of absolute coordinates
- Implement proper grouping hierarchy
- Add debug labels for development
- Include workflow instructions for Figma integration
- Maintain visual consistency across all variants
