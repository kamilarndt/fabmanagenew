# React Component Rules

- Functional components with interfaces; use the function keyword.
- Named exports only; one component per file preferred.
- Memoize expensive components with React.memo.
- useCallback for handlers passed as props; useMemo for heavy computations.
- Avoid inline functions in JSX; keep JSX shallow.
- Loading states for all async operations.
- All modals are Ant Design Drawer with placement=\right\.
- Follow unified tile edit experience across pages.

`	sx
interface DrawerFormProps { title: string; open: boolean; onClose: () => void }
export function DrawerForm({ title, open, onClose }: DrawerFormProps) {
  return (
    <Drawer title={title} open={open} onClose={onClose} placement=\right\ destroyOnClose />
  );
}
`
