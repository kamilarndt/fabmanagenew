# Business Rules

- Sequential module workflow: pricing -> concept -> technical_design -> production -> materials -> logistics.
- Tiles: Designing -> Pending Approval -> Approved -> CNC Queue -> CNC Production -> Ready Assembly.
- BOM consolidates across tiles; orders grouped by supplier; inventory real-time.
- CNC tasks prioritized by deadline and client priority; materials must be available before production.
- All user inputs validated with Zod; sanitize HTML via DOMPurify.
