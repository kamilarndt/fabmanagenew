# FabManage Migration Execution Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for executing the complete FabManage migration from old UI to new UI system. The migration follows a structured approach with monitoring, iteration, and rollback capabilities.

## Migration Pipeline

The migration consists of five main phases:

1. **Deploy to Staging** - Test the complete system
2. **User Training** - Train team on Migration Dashboard
3. **Start Migration** - Begin with Early Adopters segment
4. **Monitor & Iterate** - Use feedback and performance data
5. **Full Cut-over** - Complete migration when ready

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 7+
- Docker Desktop running
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git installed
- At least 8GB RAM available
- 20GB free disk space

### Environment Setup

- Staging environment accessible
- Migration Dashboard deployed
- Monitoring systems configured
- User segmentation service running

## Phase 1: Deploy to Staging

### Objective

Deploy the complete system to staging environment for testing and validation.

### Execution

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd D:\Cursor_Workspaces\FabManage-Clean2

# Execute staging deployment
.\scripts\deploy-staging.ps1

# Alternative: Use bash script (if WSL available)
.\scripts\deploy-staging.sh
```

### What It Does

- Builds frontend and backend applications
- Creates staging environment with Docker
- Sets up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Runs integration tests
- Generates deployment report

### Expected Output

- Staging environment running on http://localhost:8080
- Backend API on http://localhost:3001
- Grafana on http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
- Prometheus on http://localhost:9090
- Deployment report in staging directory

### Validation

- All health checks pass
- Integration tests successful
- Services accessible via URLs
- No critical errors in logs

## Phase 2: User Training

### Objective

Train the team on using the Migration Dashboard for managing the migration process.

### Execution

```powershell
# Start interactive training session
.\scripts\start-user-training.ps1 -TrainingMode interactive

# Start demo training session
.\scripts\start-user-training.ps1 -TrainingMode demo

# Start full training session (interactive + exercises + assessment)
.\scripts\start-user-training.ps1 -TrainingMode full
```

### Training Modes

- **Interactive**: Step-by-step guided training
- **Demo**: Demonstration of key features
- **Assessment**: Knowledge assessment questions
- **Full**: Complete training with hands-on exercises

### What It Covers

- Migration Dashboard overview
- User segmentation and A/B testing
- Performance monitoring
- Cut-over management
- Best practices and troubleshooting

### Expected Outcome

- Team understands migration dashboard
- Team can manage user segments
- Team can interpret A/B test results
- Team can monitor performance metrics
- Team can execute cut-over plans

## Phase 3: Start Migration (Early Adopters)

### Objective

Begin migration with Early Adopters segment (10% of users) to validate the new UI.

### Execution

```powershell
# Start Early Adopters migration
.\scripts\start-early-adopters-migration.ps1

# Dry run (no actual changes)
.\scripts\start-early-adopters-migration.ps1 -DryRun

# Skip validation checks
.\scripts\start-early-adopters-migration.ps1 -SkipValidation

# Force override existing migration
.\scripts\start-early-adopters-migration.ps1 -Force
```

### What It Does

- Enables new UI features for Early Adopters
- Sets user segmentation (10% of users)
- Starts monitoring system
- Validates success criteria
- Generates migration report

### Success Criteria

- User satisfaction > 4.0/5
- Performance score > 80/100
- Adoption rate > 85%
- Error rate < 5%

### Expected Duration

- Migration execution: 5 minutes
- Monitoring period: 24-48 hours
- Validation: Continuous

## Phase 4: Monitor & Iterate

### Objective

Continuously monitor the migration and implement iterations based on feedback and performance data.

### Execution

```powershell
# Monitor for 24 hours with 5-minute intervals
.\scripts\monitor-and-iterate.ps1 -MonitoringDuration "24h" -CheckInterval 300

# Monitor for 1 hour with auto-iteration enabled
.\scripts\monitor-and-iterate.ps1 -MonitoringDuration "1h" -AutoIterate

# Generate comprehensive report
.\scripts\monitor-and-iterate.ps1 -MonitoringDuration "12h" -GenerateReport
```

### Monitoring Parameters

- **MonitoringDuration**: Duration of monitoring (e.g., "24h", "30m", "300s")
- **CheckInterval**: Interval between checks in seconds (default: 300)
- **AutoIterate**: Automatically execute high-priority recommendations
- **GenerateReport**: Generate comprehensive monitoring report

### What It Monitors

- System performance metrics
- User feedback and satisfaction
- Error rates and stability
- Adoption rates
- Support ticket volume

### Iteration Types

- **Critical**: Immediate fixes for critical issues
- **High**: Important improvements for next sprint
- **Medium**: Optimizations for future iterations
- **Enhancement**: Opportunities for improvement

### Expected Outcome

- Continuous monitoring of migration health
- Automatic identification of issues
- Iterative improvements based on data
- Comprehensive monitoring report

## Phase 5: Full Cut-over

### Objective

Complete the migration to all users using the selected cutover strategy.

### Execution

```powershell
# Gradual cutover (recommended)
.\scripts\execute-full-cutover.ps1 -Strategy gradual

# Big bang cutover (high risk)
.\scripts\execute-full-cutover.ps1 -Strategy big-bang

# Blue-green deployment (low risk)
.\scripts\execute-full-cutover.ps1 -Strategy blue-green

# Canary deployment (low risk)
.\scripts\execute-full-cutover.ps1 -Strategy canary

# Dry run
.\scripts\execute-full-cutover.ps1 -Strategy gradual -DryRun
```

### Cutover Strategies

#### Gradual Migration (Recommended)

- **Risk**: Low
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks
- **Phases**: Early Adopters â†’ Power Users â†’ Regular Users â†’ Full Migration
- **Best for**: Large user base, complex features

#### Big Bang Migration

- **Risk**: High
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Phases**: Full Migration
- **Best for**: Small user base, simple features

#### Blue-Green Deployment

- **Risk**: Low
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Phases**: Green Environment Setup â†’ Switchover
- **Best for**: Zero-downtime requirements

#### Canary Deployment

- **Risk**: Low
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phases**: 1% â†’ 5% â†’ 25% â†’ 100%
- **Best for**: Gradual traffic increase

### Success Criteria

- User satisfaction > 4.0/5
- Performance score > 80/100
- Adoption rate > 90%
- Error rate < 5%
- System uptime > 99.9%

### Expected Outcome

- Complete migration to new UI
- All users on new system
- Old UI components disabled
- Comprehensive cutover report

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Continuous Monitoring

After cutover completion, continue monitoring for 48-72 hours:

```powershell
# Continue monitoring
.\scripts\monitor-and-iterate.ps1 -MonitoringDuration "72h" -GenerateReport
```

### Key Metrics to Watch

- User satisfaction scores
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- Support ticket volume
- System uptime

### Rollback Procedures

If issues arise, rollback procedures are available:

```powershell
# Emergency rollback (if implemented)
.\scripts\emergency-rollback.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Staging Environment Not Starting

```powershell
# Check Docker status
docker info

# Restart Docker Desktop
# Check port conflicts
netstat -an | findstr :8080
netstat -an | findstr :3001
```

#### Migration Dashboard Not Accessible

```powershell
# Check if staging is running
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check Docker containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f staging/docker-compose.staging.yml logs
```

#### Performance Issues

- Check system resources (CPU, memory)
- Review performance metrics in Grafana
- Analyze error logs
- Consider scaling resources

#### User Feedback Issues

- Review feedback in Migration Dashboard
- Check user segmentation settings
- Verify feature flag configurations
- Analyze support ticket patterns

### Getting Help

- Check system logs: `docker-compose -f staging/docker-compose.staging.yml logs`
- Review monitoring dashboards: http://localhost:3000
- Check migration status: http://localhost:8080/migration-dashboard
- Review generated reports in project directory
