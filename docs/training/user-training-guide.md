## User Segmentation

### Understanding User Segments

The system divides users into different segments for controlled migration:

#### 1. Early Adopters (10%)

- **Profile**: Expert users, high usage, premium/enterprise
- **Features**: All new UI features enabled
- **Purpose**: Provide feedback and test new features

#### 2. Power Users (20%)

- **Profile**: Experienced users, high usage, premium/enterprise
- **Features**: Core new UI features (Dashboard, Projects)
- **Purpose**: Stable, performant experience

#### 3. Regular Users (40%)

- **Profile**: Experienced users, medium usage
- **Features**: Basic new UI features (Dashboard only)
- **Purpose**: Gradual introduction to new UI

#### 4. New Users (20%)

- **Profile**: New users, active in last 30 days
- **Features**: All new UI features enabled
- **Purpose**: Start with latest UI from beginning

#### 5. Control Group (10%)

- **Profile**: Experienced users, low usage
- **Features**: Old UI only
- **Purpose**: Comparison baseline

### Managing User Segments

1. **Testing Different Segments**

   - Use the "Test User Segment" dropdown
   - Select a segment to simulate that user experience
   - Review enabled features for that segment

2. **Quick Actions**
   - **Reset to Default User**: Return to your actual user profile
   - **Enable All New UI**: Force enable all new features (testing only)
   - **Disable All New UI**: Force disable all new features (testing only)

## A/B Testing

### Understanding A/B Test Results

#### Test Configuration

- **Test Name**: Dashboard UI
- **Control Group**: Users on old UI

### Interpreting Results

#### Statistical Significance

- Look for p-values < 0.05 for statistical significance
- Consider sample size and duration of test
- Review confidence intervals

#### Performance Comparison

- Compare metrics between control and treatment groups
- Look for improvements in key performance indicators
- Identify any performance regressions

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

#### 1. Component Render Time

- **Target**: < 16ms (60fps)
- **Warning**: > 16ms
- **Action**: Optimize component rendering

#### 2. Page Load Time

- **Target**: < 3000ms (3 seconds)
- **Warning**: > 3000ms
- **Action**: Implement code splitting or lazy loading

#### 3. User Interaction Time

- **Target**: < 100ms
- **Warning**: > 100ms
- **Action**: Implement debouncing or throttling

#### 4. Memory Usage

- **Target**: < 100MB
- **Warning**: > 100MB
- **Action**: Check for memory leaks

### Performance Optimization

#### Automatic Recommendations

The system provides automatic recommendations based on performance data:

1. **Component Optimization**

   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
   - Optimize re-renders

2. **Bundle Optimization**

   - Implement code splitting
   - Use lazy loading for heavy components
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Interaction Optimization**
   - Implement debouncing for search inputs
   - Use throttling for scroll events
   - Optimize event handlers

## Cut-over Management

### Understanding Cut-over Plans

A cut-over plan is a structured approach to migrating from old UI to new UI:

#### Plan Components

1. **Phases**: Sequential steps in the migration
2. **Tasks**: Specific activities within each phase
3. **Rollback Triggers**: Conditions that trigger automatic rollback
4. **Success Criteria**: Metrics that define successful migration
5. **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies

#### Typical Cut-over Phases

1. **Preparation**

   - Final testing
   - Team training
   - Documentation updates

2. **Deployment**

   - Deploy new UI to production
   - Enable feature flags
   - Monitor initial response

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Collect user feedback
   - Address issues quickly

### Managing Cut-over Plans
