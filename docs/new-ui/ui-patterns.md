# UI Patterns

Reusable patterns to accelerate page assembly.

- Tables: TanStack-based DataTable with sort/filter/paginate, empty/loading/error states.
- Forms: react-hook-form + Zod; FormField molecule; inline errors and aria-live.
- Navigation: Sidebar + Header; "sidebar tab = card" mapping.
- Feedback: sonner toasts; non-blocking success, actionable error.
- Drawers/Sheet: right-side, focus trap, ESC, aria-modal.

Checklists

- Provide skeletons for loading, clear empty state, retry for errors.
- Keyboard navigation and roles.
