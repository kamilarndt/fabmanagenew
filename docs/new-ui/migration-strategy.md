# New UI Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the Strangler Fig pattern implementation for migrating from Ant Design to our new UI system.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Bridge Components (Current)

- Create bridge components that wrap Ant Design components
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Page-by-Page Migration

- Start with low-risk pages (Dashboard, Settings)
- Move to medium-risk pages (Projects, Materials)
- Finish with high-risk pages (Complex forms, Data tables)

### Phase 3: Component Replacement

- Replace Ant Design components with new UI equivalents
- Remove bridge components
- Clean up legacy code

## Bridge Component Strategy

### 1. Create Bridge Components

```typescript
// src/bridge-ui/Button.tsx
import { Button as AntButton } from "antd";
import { Button as NewButton } from "@/new-ui";
import { features } from "@/lib/config";

export function Button(props) {
  if (features.newUI) {
    return <NewButton {...props} />;
  }
  return <AntButton {...props} />;
}
```

### 2. Gradual Migration

- Use feature flags to control which components use new UI
- Start with 10% of users, gradually increase
- Monitor performance and user feedback

### 3. Rollback Strategy

- Feature flags allow instant rollback
- A/B testing for comparison
- Performance monitoring

## Migration Checklist

### Dashboard Page

- [ ] Create bridge components for Card, Statistic, Progress
- [ ] Implement new UI dashboard with feature flag
- [ ] A/B test with 10% of users
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Full rollout or rollback

### Projects Page

- [ ] Create bridge components for Table, Modal, Form
- [ ] Implement new UI projects page
- [ ] Test with real data
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### Materials Page

- [ ] Create bridge components for Table, Input, Select
- [ ] Implement new UI materials page
- [ ] Data validation and error handling
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] User feedback collection

### Tiles Page

- [ ] Create bridge components for Card, Badge, Button
- [ ] Implement new UI tiles page
- [ ] Complex interactions testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- Page load time
- Component render time
- Bundle size impact
- User interaction response time

### Tools

- React DevTools Profiler
- Lighthouse CI
- Custom performance monitoring
- User feedback forms

## User Feedback Collection

### Methods

- In-app feedback forms
- A/B testing surveys
- User interviews
- Analytics tracking

### Metrics

- User satisfaction scores
- Task completion rates
- Error rates
- Performance perception

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- Performance degradation
- Breaking changes
- Data loss
- User confusion

### Mitigation
